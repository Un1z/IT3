              <p>My name is Robby Ahamad, but everyone calls me Youniss, (Including my parents, a rather long and complicated story. If you want to know you can always e-mail me and i'll explain it!) and my friends are lazy so they call me Uniz.<br>
            I'm an audiovisual artist born in 1994 and raised in Antwerp.
            I have a passion for music (and the production of it), I'm a cinema enthousiast and I ofcourse like graphic design.<br>
            I like to eat pizza, drink wine, I enjoy collecting vinyl and I like petting cats (dogs are great too!).</p><br>
          
            <h1 id="designs">Some of my (visual) work</h1>
                <p>A collection of some work i've done over the year, ranging from video to graphic design to infographics and more.</p>
            <h2 id="graphs">Infographics</h2>
            <p>A set of infographics i've designed where the assignment was to save data for 4 weeks on a certain topic. 
                (I.e. week 1 was morning irritations, week 3 was feelings, week 4 was commuting.)</p>

            <h2 id="musicArt">Music Artwork</h2>
            <p>When I reached a 10000 followers on soundcloud I wanted to give out a free piece of music. Because I want to grow my brand as an audiovisual artist I decided to design a piece of art to go with the music. One that translates the audio into a stil.</p>

            <h2 id="map">Map</h2>
            <p>In school i've participated in an international design week in which me and 22 other students worked with a finish college on an application mapping unknown bits of antwerp. My team was in charge of designing the map and the icons to go with it. I specifically designed the map and helped clean up the icons.</p>

            <h1 id="music">Music</h1>
            <p>As I've mentioned before I'm also active as a musician. This has allowed me to build an expansive network of people in and out the music scene that have helped me build up a respectable customer database.
            I've played at most places in Belgium and have recently started playing outside of Belgium (A residency in Timisoara Romania).<br><br>
            <b>Biography:</b><br>
            Releasing an unconventional EP on Halogen Music late 2016, Corrupted proved himself to be a new force to be reckoned with.

            Championing his new sound that he ironically refers to as ‘Future Fuccboi Jungle’ (which takes influences from hip hop, jungle, footwork, jazz, ambient and much more) he tries to bring his own refreshing look on 160 bpm+ bass music to the scene.

            2017 is looking bright for Corrupted with forthcoming releases on Halogen Music & Ronin Ordinance as well as collabs with a multitude of artists. We can assure you that his next release will surely be one to remember<br>
